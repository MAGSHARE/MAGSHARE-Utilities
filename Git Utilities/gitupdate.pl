#   This script is written by the fine folks at MAGSHARE (http://magshare.org). There   #
#   are no licensing restrictions, but it would be...unfortunate, if folks wanted to    #
#   claim authorship that did not, in fact, do said authoring.                          #
#   With that being said, the seeds of this script started with work by Chris Jean, as  #
#   explained here:                                                                     #
#       http://chrisjean.com/2009/09/16/recursively-updating-git-submodules/            #
#   A lot of the knowledge to extend this script also came from Mark Longair, here:     #
#       http://longair.net/blog/2010/06/02/git-submodules-explained/                    #
#                                                                                       #
#   CHANGELIST:                                                                         #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.14: For some reason, the submodule directory needs to be physically deleted in  #
#           order for the latest versions to be brought in. This script now does that.  #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.13: Not sure how I got the update working properly, but it does. If you want to #
#           ensure the update works properly, then first delete the submodule directory #
#           and run gitupdate -r[l|x|nothing].                                          #
#           Added the -l option.                                                        #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.12: Added a top-level check to make sure the repository has submodules.         #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.11: Now save and reset the CWD, when using a passed-in WD.                      #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.10: Improved the directory vetting, and beefed up the comments and help.        #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.9:  Added the -x option.                                                        #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.8:  Added some credits, and the ability to specify a target directory.          #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.7:  There was some general bone-headedness in 1.0.6. This has been de-Homered.  #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.6:  Added some command-line options. In particular, the -d option, which will   #
#           delete the submodule[s] at the given level.                                 #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.5:  Found a bug, where I forgot to propagate the -r into the recursion.         $
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.4:  Now operate at the top-level only, unless specifically told to recurse,     #
#           with a -r. Set the init to before the recursion, to ensure that the various #
#           submodules are actually created BEFORE they are checked for embedded.       #
#           submodules (duh). The parsing is now a wee bit more robust.                 #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.3:  Simplified the system calls.                                                #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.2:  Now prevent incomplete modules from being counted (shouldn't happen).       #
#                                                                                       #
#   1.0.1:  Added a last statement to the loop, if there are multiple submodules, this  #
#           is necessary.                                                               #

This script recursively goes through a Git repository working copy, and "drills"
into submodules. It goes as deep as it can, and ensures that the "deepest" modules
are updated, prior to "containing" modules being updated.

USAGE:
  cd [<POSIX Path to Git Repository>]
  gitupdate.pl [-rdhx] (Operates on the CWD).
  
  OR
  
  gitupdate.pl [-rdhx] [<POSIX Path to Git Repository>]

ARGUMENTS:
  -r  Recursive   If specified, the operation will update recursively.
                  Default is one-level only.

  -d  Delete      Unlinks (deletes) the submodule mapping. Will not work with -r.

  -x  HEAD        Checks out the HEAD revisions (See Caveat).

  -l  Release     If there is a branch named "release," that is used.

  -h  Help        Prints the usage info.

BIG CAVEAT:
    It's usually not a good idea to circumvent the traditional "waterfall" release
    process. A containing submodule may actually need one of the contained modules
    to be an older version, so this could torpedo that. It's always a good idea to
    manage the release process manually. This is a "quick and dirty" method for an
    active development tree. It's useful for testing in an informal way.
    
EXAMPLES:
    Just update one repository level at the working directory:
    
        cd /usr/gitrep/MyVeryKewlGitProject
        /bin/gitupdate.pl
    
    Update a recursive repository at the working directory:
    
        cd /usr/gitrep/MyVeryKewlGitProject
        /bin/gitupdate.pl -r
    
    Delete a repository's submodule references at the working directory:
    
        cd /usr/gitrep/MyVeryKewlGitProject
        /bin/gitupdate.pl -d
    
    Recursively update to HEAD, at a specified directory:
    
        /bin/gitupdate.pl -rx /usr/gitrep/MyVeryKewlGitProject
EOF
